## The Project
_NYC Data Art_ was created by [Maddy Casey](https://mc2398.github.io/graduate_portfolio/index.html) as part of the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) LIS Student Program, which ran from January-May 2025.  The program provided Library Science graduate students with an opportunity to learn digital collection and website development skills while building a custom CollectionBuilder based site.

Metadata for the collection was either contributed by the artists responsible for the piece, or written by Maddy Casey.  Images for the collection were taken and supplied by the Creator of the piece, except where otherwise noted. Subject terms included for the collection were either sourced from the Library of Congress Subject Headings, with the exception of “Data Art” and “Data Physicalization” which are local terms.

## What is Data Physicalization?
In practice- “Data Physicalizations” go by many names, including data visceralization, tangible data, data objects, and analog data art. Data physicalizations convey structured information (data) through a material expression. The materials used can include textiles, organic matter, sculptural materials, and often engage multiple senses through sounds, smells, and touch. In practice, data physicalizations often seek to heighten viewers’ engagement with data.

## What is Data Art?
Data art, in contrast, often refers to a subset of data visualizations (charts or graphics which convey and share data digitally) which incorporates significant elements of artistic practice and design.  

## The Collection

All of the projects included in this collection are examples of data physicalizations or data art, which were either created by New York City based artists, incorporate data about New York City, or both.

Many of the included projects were created as part of a summer class about Data Physicalization at the [Pratt Institute School of Information](https://www.pratt.edu/information/).  Students who contributed work to this project were all pursuing Masters of Science degrees in either Library and Information Science or Data Analytics & Visualization.  The subject matter and materials explored by the projects vary extensively, but all embody the creative praxis and exploration of information enabled by expressing data in a physical medium, and as art more broadly. The projects included in this collection involved extensive labor, as the artists collected and transformed datasets, and iteratively developed handmade expressions of the data.
